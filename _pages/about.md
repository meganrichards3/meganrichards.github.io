## About Me
I am an AI Resident at [Meta AI](https://ai.meta.com/research/) (FAIR labs) where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Mark Ibrahim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=AqYyoCMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Diane Bouchacourt](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iXOzeWUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). My work is motivated by efforts to **characterize and improve real-world reliability**, with a focus on fairness, out-of-distribution generalization, and robustness topics in vision/vision-language models. Most recently, I have worked on [using geographically diverse datasets as more realistic distribution shift benchmarks](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=Fw7f9eoAAAAJ&authuser=2&citation_for_view=Fw7f9eoAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC), and characterizing the [geographical fairness of vision models](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=Fw7f9eoAAAAJ&authuser=2&citation_for_view=Fw7f9eoAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C).  

Previously, I completed my undergradate at Duke University, where I worked with [Mark Sendak](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U0kHK8wAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) as part of the [Duke Institute for Healthcare Innovation (DIHI)](https://dihi.org/projects/). At DIHI, I worked on building risk prediction models for [severe pregnancy complications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=Fw7f9eoAAAAJ&authuser=2&citation_for_view=Fw7f9eoAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C), and helping implement a [data quality assurance framework](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v182/sendak22a.html) which improved model consistency in practice by faciliating more clinically informed data processing.  I also worked at the [Duke Center for Global Women's Health Technologies](https://www.dukegwht.org/) on a [self-screening device](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=Fw7f9eoAAAAJ&authuser=2&citation_for_view=Fw7f9eoAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC) for cervical cancer designed for low-income, underserved global settings.  

**I'm very excited to be applying to PhD programs this fall (2023/2024 cycle) - if you are looking for PhD students or would recommend people I should work with, feel free to reach out!**

## Recent Updates

- **July '23**: I'm thrilled to be attending ICML '23 with a poster at the [Data-Centric Machine learning Research (DMLR)](dmlr.ai) workshop (full paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13136)). I'm also part of an amazing team organizing a breakout session at the [Women in Machine Learning](https://sites.google.com/wimlworkshop.org/wiml-unworkshop-2023/home?authuser=0) workshop entitled "Leveraging Large Scale Models for Identifying and Fixing Deep Neural Networks Biases" (see our slides [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19do6FdisYV5OFY26jH-nvbB9CihDAcBg/view?usp=sharing)).
