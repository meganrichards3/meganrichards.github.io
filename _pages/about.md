## About Me
I am an AI Resident at [Meta AI](https://ai.meta.com/research/) (FAIR labs) where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Mark Ibrahim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=AqYyoCMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Diane Bouchacourt](https://dianebouchacourt.github.io/). I study the **foundations of reliable machine learning**, with the goal of understanding model behavior and leveraging these insights to improve reliability in real-world settings. I'm broadly interested in understanding how models learn, the ways they fail, and how we can build more robust, fair, and rational systems. Most recently, I have studied geographical failures in vision models, including studying the [widening progress gap between imagenet-based benchmarks and global, crowdsourced data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13136) (ICLR 2024), and investigating the [mechanisms of geographical bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05391) (Spotlight, NeurIPS 2023). 

My current research interests are largely motivated by my experiences deploying ML-based tools in high-stakes settings. I completed my undergradate at Duke University, where I worked with [Mark Sendak](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U0kHK8wAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) as part of the Duke Institute for Healthcare Innovation ([DIHI](https://dihi.org/projects/)). At DIHI, I worked on building risk prediction models for [severe pregnancy complications](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59d5ac1780bd5ef9c396eda6/t/62eb0bc60a2601399afdfecf/1659571143037/108+MEWS_Abstract.pdf), which are now integrated and in silent trials. I also worked with DIHI to implement a [data quality assurance framework](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v182/sendak22a.html) which improved model performance by better integrating clinical feedback into dataset design. While at Duke, I also worked at the [Duke Center for Global Women's Health Technologies](https://www.dukegwht.org/) on a [self-screening device](https://spj.science.org/doi/full/10.34133/2022/9823184?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D14000684186094648760814905405683999528%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1696809600) for cervical cancer designed for low-resource global settings, which earned a Best Research award at NIH's IEEE HIPOCT Conference in 2019. 

**I'm very excited to be applying to PhD programs this fall (2023/2024 cycle) - if you are looking for PhD students or would recommend people I should work with, I'd love to hear from you!**

## Recent Updates
- **Jan '24**: We're thrilled to have our work accepted at [ICLR 2024](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/CallForPapers)! Our work demonstrates a widening progress gap between imagenet-based benchmarks and global, crowdsourced data, driven by significant overrepresentation of western images in internet-scraped datasets. Camera-ready coming soon!   
  
- **Dec '23**: We're honored to receive a **spotlight award** at NeurIPS 2023 under the datasets track for our paper investigating mechanisms of geographical bias in vision models! See full paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05391), and explore our released annotations through our webpage [here](https://dollarstreetfactors.metademolab.com/?at=-24%2C40.67%2C2.5)!  

- **July '23**: I'm at ICML '23 with a poster at the [Data-Centric Machine learning Research (DMLR)](https://dmlr.ai/) workshop (full paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13136)). I'm also part of an amazing team organizing a breakout session on robustness and large-scale vision models at the [Women in Machine Learning](https://sites.google.com/wimlworkshop.org/wiml-unworkshop-2023/home?authuser=0) workshop ([slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19do6FdisYV5OFY26jH-nvbB9CihDAcBg/view?usp=sharing)).

- **June '23**: I'm excited to be back at Machine Learning for Healthcare ([MLHC](https://www.mlforhc.org/)) with a poster describing our experiences deploying risk prediction models for maternal health at Duke.  

- **July '22**: Our [paper](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v182/sendak22a.html) on data quality in healthcare applications has been published at MLHC '22! We introduce a clinically-guided data quality assurance framework, validating the framework on 5 distinct clinical projects in two countries.
