I am an AI Resident at [Meta AI](https://ai.meta.com/research/) (FAIR labs) where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Mark Ibrahim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=AqYyoCMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Diane Bouchacourt](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iXOzeWUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). My work is motivated by efforts to **characterize and improve real-world reliability**, with a focus on fairness, out-of-distribution generalization, and robustness topics in vision/vision-language models. 


Previously, I completed my undergradate at Duke University, where I worked closely with [Mark Sendak](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U0kHK8wAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) as part of the [Duke Institute for Healthcare Innovation (DIHI)](https://dihi.org/projects/). At DIHI, I worked on building risk prediction models for [severe pregnancy complications](), and helping implement a [data quality assurance framework](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v182/sendak22a.html) which improved model consistency in practice by faciliating more clincally informed data processing.  

**I'm very excited to be applying to PhD programs this fall (2023/2024 cycle) - if you are looking for PhD students or would recommend people I should work with, feel free to reach out!**
