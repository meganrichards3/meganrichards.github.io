## About Me
I am an AI Resident at [Meta AI](https://ai.meta.com/research/) (FAIR labs) where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Mark Ibrahim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=AqYyoCMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Diane Bouchacourt](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iXOzeWUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). My work is motivated by efforts to **characterize and improve real-world reliability**, with a focus on fairness, out-of-distribution generalization, and robustness topics in vision/vision-language models. Most recently, I have worked on [using geographically diverse datasets as more realistic distribution shift benchmarks](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=Fw7f9eoAAAAJ&authuser=2&citation_for_view=Fw7f9eoAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC), and characterizing the [geographical fairness of vision models](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=Fw7f9eoAAAAJ&authuser=2&citation_for_view=Fw7f9eoAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C).  

Previously, I completed my undergradate at Duke University, where I worked with [Mark Sendak](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U0kHK8wAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) as part of the [Duke Institute for Healthcare Innovation (DIHI)](https://dihi.org/projects/). At DIHI, I worked on building risk prediction models for [severe pregnancy complications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=Fw7f9eoAAAAJ&authuser=2&citation_for_view=Fw7f9eoAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C), and helping implement a [data quality assurance framework](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v182/sendak22a.html) which improved model consistency in practice by faciliating more clinically informed data processing.  I also worked at the [Duke Center for Global Women's Health Technologies](https://www.dukegwht.org/) on a [self-screening device](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=Fw7f9eoAAAAJ&authuser=2&citation_for_view=Fw7f9eoAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC) for cervical cancer designed for low-income, underserved global settings.  

**I'm very excited to be applying to PhD programs this fall (2023/2024 cycle) - if you are looking for PhD students or would recommend people I should work with, feel free to reach out!**

## Recent Updates

- **July '23**: I'm at ICML '23 with a poster at the [Data-Centric Machine learning Research (DMLR)](https://dmlr.ai/) workshop (full paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13136)). I'm also part of an amazing team organizing a breakout session on robustness and large-scale vision models at the [Women in Machine Learning](https://sites.google.com/wimlworkshop.org/wiml-unworkshop-2023/home?authuser=0) workshop ([slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19do6FdisYV5OFY26jH-nvbB9CihDAcBg/view?usp=sharing)).

- **June '23**: I'm excited to be back at Machine Learning for Healthcare ([MLHC](https://www.mlforhc.org/)) with a poster describing our experiences deploying risk prediction models for maternal health at Duke.  

- **April '23**: Our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05391) releasing fine-grained annotations for the DollarStreet benchmark is on arxiv! We show how income and regional biases in object recognition models can be (partially) attributed to robustness failures to factors such as texture and lighting, and release a comphensive set of annotations for future work. 

- **July '22**: Our [paper](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v182/sendak22a.html) on data quality in healthcare applications has been published at MLHC '22! We introduce a clinically-guided data quality assurance framework, validating the framework on 5 distinct clinical projects in two countries.
