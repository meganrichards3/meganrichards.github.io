## About Me
I am an AI Resident at [Meta AI](https://ai.meta.com/research/) (FAIR labs) where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Mark Ibrahim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=AqYyoCMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Diane Bouchacourt](https://dianebouchacourt.github.io/). I study the **foundations of reliable machine learning**, with the goal of undertanding model behavior and leveraging these insights to improve reliability in real-world settings. I'm broadly interested in understanding how models learn, the ways they fail, and how we can build more reliable, fair, and robust systems. Most recently, I have studied geographical bias in vision models, including studying the [widening progress gap between imagenet-based benchmarks and global, crowdsourced data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13136), and investigating the [mechanisms of geographical bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05391). 

Previously, I completed my undergradate at Duke University, where I worked with [Mark Sendak](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U0kHK8wAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) as part of the Duke Institute for Healthcare Innovation ([DIHI](https://dihi.org/projects/)). At DIHI, I worked on building risk prediction models for [severe pregnancy complications](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59d5ac1780bd5ef9c396eda6/t/62eb0bc60a2601399afdfecf/1659571143037/108+MEWS_Abstract.pdf), and helping implement a [data quality assurance framework](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v182/sendak22a.html) which improved model consistency in practice by faciliating more clinically informed data processing.  I also worked at the [Duke Center for Global Women's Health Technologies](https://www.dukegwht.org/) on a [self-screening device](https://spj.science.org/doi/full/10.34133/2022/9823184?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D14000684186094648760814905405683999528%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1696809600) for cervical cancer designed for low-resource global settings.  

**I'm very excited to be applying to PhD programs this fall (2023/2024 cycle) - if you are looking for PhD students or would recommend people I should work with, I'd love to hear from you!**

## Recent Updates
- **Sept '23**: We're honored to receive a spotlight award at NeurIPS 2023 under the datasets track for our paper investigating mechanisms of geographical bias in vision models! See full paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05391), and explore our released annotations [here](https://dollarstreetfactors.metademolab.com/?at=-24%2C40.67%2C2.5)!  

- **July '23**: I'm at ICML '23 with a poster at the [Data-Centric Machine learning Research (DMLR)](https://dmlr.ai/) workshop (full paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13136)). I'm also part of an amazing team organizing a breakout session on robustness and large-scale vision models at the [Women in Machine Learning](https://sites.google.com/wimlworkshop.org/wiml-unworkshop-2023/home?authuser=0) workshop ([slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19do6FdisYV5OFY26jH-nvbB9CihDAcBg/view?usp=sharing)).

- **June '23**: I'm excited to be back at Machine Learning for Healthcare ([MLHC](https://www.mlforhc.org/)) with a poster describing our experiences deploying risk prediction models for maternal health at Duke.  

- **July '22**: Our [paper](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v182/sendak22a.html) on data quality in healthcare applications has been published at MLHC '22! We introduce a clinically-guided data quality assurance framework, validating the framework on 5 distinct clinical projects in two countries.
